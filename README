sfDoctrineAssetsLibrary plugin
==============================

This is the sfAssetsLibraryPlugin Doctrine porting.

The `sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin` is a full-featured multimedia asset library plugin.
Not only does it allow you to upload and organize your media files
(images, PDF documents, Flash objects, and so on) via a web interface, it also
stores metadata about each file for easy retrieval or automated copyright and
legend inclusion. It is the perfect companion for rich text editors like TinyMCE.

Prerequisites
-------------

This plugin for symfony 1.4 depends on [sfThumbnailPlugin](/plugins/sfThumbnailPlugin)
to create thumbnails of image files. If this plugin is not yest installed, the symfony
plugin dependency system will install it when you install `sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin`.

Note: If [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) is installed (no need for the PEAR
Imagick package, the plugin calls the `convert` script of the basic Image Magic
library), then the image thumbnails will be of better quality. See the "Configuration"
section below for the way to activate ImageMagick support in the plugin.

Installation
------------

1 - Install the plugin.

The easiest way to install `sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin` is to use the symfony command line:

    > php symfony plugin:install sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin

Alternatively, if you don't have PEAR installed, you can download the latest package
attached to this page and extract it under your project's `plugins/`
directory. You can also refer to the plugin's Subversion repository by doing a
checkout or an `svn:externals` of `http://svn.github.com/odracci/sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin.git`
or use github repository: `http://github.com/odracci/sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin.git`

If you use one of these alternative methods, you must enable the plugin in your
`ProjectConfiguration.class.php` file and publish the plugin assets by
calling the `plugin:publish-assets` symfony task.

2 - Build the data structures

Rebuild the model and generate the SQL code for the new tables:

    > php symfony doctrine:build --all-classes --sql

Create the new tables in your database.

    > php symfony doctrine:insert-sql

3 - Configure your project to use the plugin features

Enable the `sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin` and the `sfThumbnailPlugin` in the project
configuration (unless you installed using `plugin:install`)

    [php]
    // in myproject/config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php
    class ProjectConfiguration extends sfProjectConfiguration
    {
      public function setup()
      {
        $this->enablePlugins(array('sfPropelPlugin', 'sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin', 'sfThumbnailPlugin'));
      }
    }

Enable the `sfAsset` module in your backend application, via the
`settings.yml` file.

    [yml]
    // in myproject/apps/backend/config/settings.yml
    all:
      .settings:
        enabled_modules:        [default, sfAsset]

Configure the path to the root assets directory in the `app.yml` file:

    [yml]
    // in myproject/config/app.yml
    all:
      sfAssetsLibrary:
        upload_dir:               media

In the above example, uploaded files will be stored under the `web/media`
directory.

4 - Clear the cache to enable the autoloading to find the new classes:

    > php symfony cc

5 - Use the bundled `asset:create-root` task to initialize the root asset
directory in the filesystem and in the database. The name of the root asset
directory will be read from the `app.yml` configuration you just defined:

    > php symfony asset:create-root

>**NOTE**
>*nix users must call this command with the same user group as the http
>server, because it will need write access to this directory. Alternatively,
>`chmod 777` or `chgrp` can be used.

6 - You can now start using the plugin by browsing to the backend module's
default page:

    http://myproject/backend_dev.php/sfAsset

Configuration
-------------

You can modify the plugin settings by way of the configuration. Here is a list
of the settings you can change in your application's `app.yml`:

    [yml]
    # in apps/backend/config/app.yml
    all:
      sfAssetsLibrary:
        upload_dir:       media              # Asset library root, under the web/ dir
        check_type:       false              # Set to true if you want to restrict the type of assets
        types:                               # Accepted asset types if check_type is true
          image:   image
          txt:     txt
          archive: archive
          pdf:     pdf
          xls:     xls
          doc:     doc
          ppt:     ppt
        thumbnail_dir:    thumbnail          # Where the image thumbnails are stored
        use_ImageMagick:  false              # Set to true if you have the convert command
        thumbnails:                          # Name and size (in pixels) of the thumbnails created at upload
          small:                             # Displayed in the list page
            width: 84
            height: 84
            shave: true                      # Cut strips to constraint the image size
          large:                             # Displayed in the details page
            width: 194
            height: 152
        search_pager_size: 20                # Number of resuts per page
        mass_upload_size:  5                 # Number of file upload controls displayed in the mass upload form


The `sfAsset` module
--------------------

The `sfAsset` module provides four main features:
 - Browse through your media files like in a filesystem.
 - Read or change metadata for a particular file
 - Perform usual filesystem operations on your files and folder (add, move, rename, delete)
 - Search for a particular media file from its filename, description, author, etc.

The module has two main views (`list` and `edit`) that you can easily customize by
using your own CSS or overriding some of their numerous partials in your application.
The templates are organized the same way as the admin generated modules, so applying
your own look and feel to the `sfDoctrineAssetsLibrary` should be easy.

The module is fully i18n'ed, and the plugin comes with English, French, Italian,
and German translations.

>**NOTE**
>It's very important that you point the main module from your links (e.g. a navigation menu)
>to the route `@sf_asset_library_root`. Skipping this passage could lead to problems with layout,
>since the popup layout is different from the "standard" one.

Using the assets from the library in your applications
------------------------------------------------------

Uploaded assets end up under the `sfConfig::get('sf_web_root') . sfConfig::get('app_sfAssetsLibrary_upload_dir')`
directory. The path to a particular media file appears in its details page fo the
`sfAsset` module, so if you need to use it somewhere in your application, just
copy this path. Alternatively, if you need to include an image tag to an asset
you retrieved from the database, you can use the `asset_image_tag()` helper:

    [php]
    <?php use_helper('sfAsset') ?>
    <?php echo asset_image_tag($sf_asset) ?>


Importing assets from an existing library (not ready)
-----------------------------------------------------

Whether you want to add assets to your library from an existing sfMediaLibrary,
or to cleanup your database of removed files, you will probably need to synchronize
the assets database with a directory.

Fortunately, the plugin comes with a task `asset:synchronize` to do just that:

    > php symfony asset:synchronize [app] [dirname] --notVerbose --removeOrphanAssets --removeOrphanFolders

For instance, to import an existing Media Library under `web/uploads/media` to
the sfAssetsLibrary, just type:

    > php symfony asset:synchronize backend /path/to/project/web/uploads/media --removeOrphanAssets --removeOrphanFolders

You can call this task as many times you want, since it only performs database and
filesystem operations when the two sources are not in sync.

Using the assets library with TinyMCE (not tested)
--------------------------------------------------

If you want to use the `sfAssetsLibrary` plugin as a replacement for tinyMCE's file
browser for image insertion, you must first initiate the plugin with a helper in
the template:

    [php]
    <?php use_helper('sfAsset') ?>
    <?php use_javascript('tiny_mce/tiny_mce') /* must point to your actual path of tinyMCE */ ?>
    <?php use_javascript('tiny_mce/setup) /* you must create setup.js, see below */ ?>
    <?php echo init_asset_library() ?>

You need to create a setup.js file in tiny_mce directory (you can name this file as you
prefer and store it whenever you want, as long as you point it correctly).
This is an example of its content:

    [javascript]
    tinyMCE.init({
      theme : "advanced",
      mode: "textareas",
      editor_selector : "rich",
      relative_urls: false,
      file_browser_callback : 'sfAssetsLibrary.fileBrowserCallBack'
    });

Please refer to [official documentation](http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Configuration)
for more detailed configuration.

That's it, the TinyMCE file browser is now the `sfAssetsLibrary`'s one.

>**TIP**: For use with an admin generated module, place the `init_asset_library()` call
>in the `_assets.php` partial in the `templates/` directory of the module. If you miss
>that template, just copy it from the cache auto-generated module.
>To add class in a `generator.yml`, do as follows:

    [yml]
    generator:
    # ...
        config:
      # ...
        form:
          fields:
            foo: { attributes: { class: rich, rows: 5, cols: 70 } }

Using the assets library with CK Editor (not tested)
----------------------------------------------------

If you want to use the `sfDoctrineAssetsLibrary` plugin as a CKEditors's file
browser for file or image insertion, you must first add to `routing.yml` file:

    [yml]
    sf_asset_list:
      url:   /mediapopup
      param: { module: sfAsset, action: list }

Then you must initiate the plugin with a helper in the template:

    [php]
    <?php use_helper('sfAsset') ?>
    <?php use_javascript('ckeditor/ckeditor') /* must point to your actual path of CKEditor */ ?>
    

For example if id of textarea is `myrich` then somewhare under this field we need to put

    [php]
    <script type="text/javascript">
    CKEDITOR.replace( 'myrich',
        {
            filebrowserBrowseUrl : '<?php echo get_asset_url() ?>',
            filebrowserUploadUrl : '<?php echo get_asset_url() ?>'
        });
    </script>

Please refer to [official documentation](http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide)
for more detailed configuration.

>**TIP**: For use with an admin generated module, place Java Script with CKEDITOR.replace
>in the `_form_footer.php` partial in the `templates/` directory of the module. 
>To add id in a `generator.yml`, do as follows:

For use with an admin generated module:

    [yml]
    generator:
    # ...
        config:
      # ...
        form:
          fields:
            foo: { attributes: { id: myrich, rows: 5, cols: 70 } }

>**TIP**: To use ckeditor for all textareas in form globaly use CKEDITOR.replaceAll()
>Please refer to [official documentation](http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.html#.replaceAll)
>for more detailed configuration. 


Using the form's widget
-----------------------

Traditionally, when an asset has to be referenced in a form, a file input is used
(`<input type='file'>`). It allows the user to upload a file from his computer to
the server, and this file can be further embedded in a rich text content.

Using the `sfDoctrineAssetsLibraryPlugin`, you can change this control into some sort of
file input that refers to the assets library, or, to put it differently, to the
files located on the server in `web/media`. The plugin comes with a special widget
for that purpose, the `sfWidgetFormAssetInput`. Use is just like a regular widget:

    [php]
    public function configure()
    {
      $this->widgetSchema['asset_id'] = new sfWidgetFormAssetInput();
      // usually you don't need to define validator, it should be already defined in generated form
      $this->validatorSchema['asset_id'] = new sfValidatorPropelChoice('model' => 'sfAsset');
    }

If not in admin generator, remember to use `use_javascripts_for_form($form)` in your form's template.

This input is not a real file input tag, meaning that the chosen asset file will not
be posted with the request. Instead, the action will be able to retrieve the asset
file path relative to the web root, exactly what is needed to display it. Incidentally,
this means that your form doesn't need to be set multipart.

Optionally, you can restrict the choice of possible assets in this input to images
only, as follows:

    [php]
    $this->widgetSchema['asset_id'] = new sfWidgetFormAssetInput(array('asset_type' => 'image'))


Thumbnails of PDF files
-----------------------

If you use ImageMagick, a nice thumbnail of PDF file is generated and used instead of default
type icon. Thumbnail could be wrong in some limited cases. Please check
[this ticket](http://trac.symfony-project.org/ticket/4116) to know more about the issue.
